int that ex. we were asked to create a function that print
all the possible combination from 00 01 to 98 99.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>EXPECTED OUTPUT<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

00 01, 00 02, 00 03, 00 04, 00 05,...., 98 99 $>


well ,i used some extra function in my code just make things
look in good shape .
the functions i've used : 
ft_ptchar : this function just to put characters.
ft_putnbr : to handle the numbers soo we can put em using
ft_ptchar.
the rest of the code was the main body were i wrote the 
combination's logic.

alright let's talk abt the logic 
all what i did was easy and familiar , i declared two integers
x & y i , i gave them the index start and a while loop to go
throught all possible combination , Here is how i looks :


void ft_print_comb2(void)
{
        int x;
        int y;

        x = 0;
        while(x <= 98)
        {
                y = x + 1;
                while(y <= 99)
                {
                        ft_putnbr(x, y);
                        y++;
                }
                x++;
        }
}
