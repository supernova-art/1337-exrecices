We are writing a function that displays characters .
first thing let's breakdown the function protype >

	void ft_putchar(char c)

"void" , means that the fct returns nothing .
"ft_putchar" , is the fct name [it like any other normal name] .
"(char c)" , inside the fct that we mentioned before we're declaring a parameter (go to parametrs section) .

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<OBJECTIF>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


The objectif of this exercice is to understand how a write function works .
The write function is composed of three main elements :
		1st : file descriptor .
			there is 3 types of file descriptor :
				> 0 ==> standar input.
				> 1 ==> standar output.
				> 2 ==> standar error. 
		
		2nd : adress to a buffer .
			it's an adress in memory that points to a string [like a pointer] .

		3rd : size .
			the number of bytes needed to print the given string .
