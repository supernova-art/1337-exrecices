a POINTER is a special type of variable that stores the 
memory address of another variable .
instead of holding a direct value (like 0 or 42) , a 
pointer holds where that value is located in memory .

 WHAT IS A POINTER USED FOR IN C ?
A pointerr is used to :
1. Access and modify var. indirectly through their memory
address .
2. Pass dtat to function without making copies (changing 
the original values ).

3. It helps to wrok with strings and arrays .
4. manage dynamic memory using function like
malloc & free .

Some of u folks will think and says " why we would 
change a variables's value ?" . Well , sometimes 
u need  from ir function to return 2 values at the same 
time , so in C a function can return only one variable's 
value , meaning u cannot return two variables . So , the
only solution we have is to work with pointers to be able
to change that variable's value and return it multiple 
times ( depends on what u need from ur code ) . We use 
pointers to change V.V becuz in C when u declare a 
function makes a copie of it and u works with it
The pointers gives u guys the ability to change 
(or work) in the original one .

1. Definition :
	A pointer is a variable that stores he memory 
address of another variable , it doesn't hold a value 
itself , but the location of that value .

2. How it works :
	& -----> gives the address of a variable .
	* -----> accesses or change the value of that add.

		EXAMPLE : 
		
		int *p = &n;
		int n = 20;
 // giving to the pointer p the	address of n
		*p = 42; //the value of n is changed .

2. Why we would use the pointers ? 

. To modify original variables inside functions ( not 
just copies ).
. To return multiple values from a function .
. To work with arrays , strings , and structures 
efficiently .
. To allocate and manage memory dynamically(malloc , free)

4. Pointer types :

You can have pointers of any type-int * , float *, char *
ect... .
Each type tells C how many bytes to read or write .

5 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>IMPORTANT NOTE<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

. Unintialized pointers cause errors , always points
them to somewhere or set them to "NULL" .
. You can declare a pointer first and give it an address
later . 

EXAMPLE : 
	int n = 0;
	int *p = &n;
	*p = 42;

///////////////////////OR//////////////////////////
	int n = 0;
	int *p = NULL; // the pointer now is initialized
	//u can give it an address later (Be carfull
	// , u can give it an address only , not a value
	// becus it doesn't hold any address yet.
